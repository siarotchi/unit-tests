# GitHub User details
This is the sample app with mocked data to display a GitHub user details

## How the app works

Run the app (`npm start`)<br />
Type into search box any string and press enter<br />
The details of a mocked user should appear below the search box<br />
The details box has a 'show email' button, on click it should display user's email and hide the button
